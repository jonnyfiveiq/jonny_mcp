# Ansible Automation Platform MCP Server

This project provides a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** for interacting with **Ansible Automation Platform (AAP)** through Claude or other MCP-aware clients.  
It allows you to chat with Claude and run AAP operations (e.g. ping the controller, list jobs, create/run job templates).
